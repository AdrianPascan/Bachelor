We want a distributed program that computes the convolution of two vectors of equal length, that is, it computes
a vector r with r[k] equal to the sum of all a[i]*b[k-i] for i from 0 to the length of the vectors minus one.

You shall implement two functions (in C++, Java or C\#):

vector<int> primes(vector<int> const& a, vector<int> const& b, int nrProcs);

that will run on the process 0 of the MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator, where a and b are the input vectors (assumed of equal length) and nrProcs is the
number of processes in the world communicator.

void worker(int myId, int nrProcs);

will run on all other processesin the world communicator, with myId representing the rank and nrProcs the number of processes.
