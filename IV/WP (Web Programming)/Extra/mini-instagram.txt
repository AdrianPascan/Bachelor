Solve the following problem using the JSP/Servlet technology. 
State information (between web requests) is always stored in a database;
you may store some state information in cookies/session objects. 
Write a web application which allows users to upload pictures. 
Each user sees the pictures of all users and he/she can assign votes 
(natural numbers) for other users' pictures (not for his own pictures). 
If a picture gets votes from several users, these votes are added. 
The application then displays the top N pictures and the corresponding 
authors of these pictures, based on the number of votes; the number N 
should be chosen by the user. Each user must identify himself prior to 
using the application.
