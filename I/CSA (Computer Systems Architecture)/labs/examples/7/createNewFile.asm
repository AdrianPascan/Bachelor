; The following code will create an empty file called "ana.txt" in the current folder.

; The program will use:
; - the function fopen() to open/create the file
; - the function fclose() to close the created file.

; Because the program uses the file access mode "w", if a file with the same name already
; exists, its contents will be discarded and the file will be treated as a new empty file.
; For details about the file access modes see the section "Theory".
