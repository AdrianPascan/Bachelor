; The following code will open a file called "ana.txt" from current folder,
; it will read maximum 100 characters from this file,
; and it will display to the console the number of chars and the text we've read.

; The program will use:
; - the function fopen() to open/create the file
; - the function fread() to read from file
; - the function printf() to display a text
; - the function fclose() to close the created file.

; Because the fopen() call uses the file access mode "r", the file will be open for
; reading. The file must exist, otherwise the fopen() call will fail.
; For details about the file access modes see the section "Theory".

; Any string used by printf() must be null-terminated ('\0').
