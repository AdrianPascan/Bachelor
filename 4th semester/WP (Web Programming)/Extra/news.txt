Write a web application for a news service. Some users add or update news and others just view news. 
News are saved on a database and they have the following characteristics: text of the news, title, 
producer, date, category (politics, society, health etc.). The user who adds or updates news must log in
 using a username and password before doing this. The other type of users can see all the news from a 
range of dates and all news from a specific category (use AJAX for these filters). Also, on the news 
browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. date range, category), should 
be displayed (do this in javascript).
